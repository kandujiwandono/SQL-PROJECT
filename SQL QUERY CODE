-- THIS IS MY NEW PROJECT
-- THIS PROJECT USES BIGQUERY AS A TOOLS TO EXTRACT DATA
-- DATA OBTAINED FROM BIGQUERY PUBLIC DATA = LONDON CRIME LSOA

FINDING WHAT CRIME HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER EACH YEAR at CITY OF LONDON

first, select the data only for city of london borough and find the number of each crime per year
		--total crime_per category_per year in city of london--
		SELECT major_category, year,  SUM(value) AS total_crime_per_year
		FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
		WHERE borough = 'City of London'
		GROUP BY year, major_category
		ORDER BY year;
		
second, select maximum number of crime per year, and what crime it is

		WITH dummy AS (
		  SELECT major_category, year, MAX(total_crime_per_year) AS total_crime, RANK () OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY MAX(total_crime_per_year) DESC) AS crime_ranks 
		  FROM (
			SELECT major_category, year,  SUM(value) AS total_crime_per_year
			FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
			WHERE borough = 'City of London'
			GROUP BY year, major_category)
		  GROUP BY major_category, year
		  ORDER BY year)
		  
		SELECT major_category, year, total_crime
		FROM DUMMY
		WHERE crime_ranks = 1; 
		
from the table we can conclude that the majority of the crime occured in london city from 2008 until 2016 is theft and handling

if we look further in the data, the number of crime occured in london city from 2008 until 2010 was 0. this indicated that either the data is not correctly inputed or there was no data for those period of year
so we can conclude that the main crime of london city from 2011 until 2016 is Theft and Handling.


FINDING WHEN WAS THE LOWEST CRIME AND THE HIGHEST CRIME OCCURED IN LONDON CITY

to find the lowest and the highest crime number from 2011 until 2016 i use this query to rank the number of crime per year

		SELECT year, total_crime_per_year AS crime_num
		FROM (
		  SELECT year, SUM(value) AS total_crime_per_year
		  FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
		  WHERE borough = 'City of London'
		  GROUP BY year)
		WHERE year NOT IN (2008, 2009, 2010)
		ORDER BY crime_rank;
		
FINDING WHICH BOROUGH IS THE SAFER

		SELECT borough, SUM(value) AS total_crime
		FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
		GROUP BY borough
		ORDER BY total_crime;

from the query above we can conclude that city of london was the safer borough and westminster was the toughest borough

WHAT IS THE AVERAGE CRIME NUMBER OCCURED PER YEAR FOR EACH BOROUGH

		SELECT borough, year, AVG(value) AS average_crime
		FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
		GROUP BY year, borough
		ORDER BY year ASC, average_crime DESC;

based on the query result, westminster has the highest average crime per year. the number almost doubled camden crime number.
this indicates that the police should more active in westminster.

WHAT IS THE HIGHEST CRIME OCCURED IN WESTMINSTER EACH YEAR

		WITH dummy AS (
		  SELECT borough, year, major_category, MAX(crime_per_year) AS total_crime, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY max(crime_per_year) DESC) AS crime_ranks
		  FROM (
			SELECT borough, year, major_category, SUM(value) AS crime_per_year
			FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
			WHERE borough = 'Westminster'
			GROUP BY year, major_category, borough)
		  GROUP BY year, major_category, borough
		  ORDER BY year)
		  
		SELECT *
		FROM DUMMY
		WHERE crime_ranks = 1;
		
theft and handling still the most crime in westminster. 

WHAT IS MONTHLY AVERAGE CRIME IN WESTMINSTER?

		SELECT borough, month, AVG(value) AS average_crime
		FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
		WHERE borough = 'Westminster'
		GROUP BY borough, month
		ORDER BY average_crime DESC;
		
from the query we can conclude that the police should tighten the security at westminster when december comes
the crime number may be risen because of christmas. 


WHAT IS THE MONTH WHICH HAD THE HIGHEST AVERAGE CRIME NUMBER FOR EACH BOROUGH ???
		
		SELECT borough, month, avg_crime
		FROM (
		  SELECT borough, month, AVG(value) as avg_crime, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY borough ORDER BY AVG(value) DESC) as crime_rank
		  FROM `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
		  GROUP BY borough, month)
		WHERE crime_rank = 1
		ORDER BY month;
 
 from the query result we can conclude that, the police should focused the security in 
 1. Barking and Dagenham, Bexley, Enfield, Harrow, Havering, and Sutton at March; 
 2. Camden, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Richmond upon Thames at May; 
 3. Hackney and Waltham Forest at June;
